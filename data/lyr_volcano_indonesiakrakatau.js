Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 CE, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes, and left only a remnant of Rakata volcano. This eruption, the 2nd largest in Indonesia during historical time, caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of devastating tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java.  Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan. Anak Krakatau has been the site of frequent eruptions since 1927.<\/p><\/td><\/tr>\n<tr height=\"6\"><td colspan=\"2\"><hr \/><\/td><\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"320\" align=\"center\">\n<tr align=\"center\">\n<td width=\"33%\"><a href=\"http:\/\/volcano.si.edu\/volcano.cfm?vn=262000\">Smithsonian Volcano Information<\/a><\/td>\n\n\n<\/tr><\/table>","timestamp":null,"begin":null,"end":null,"altitudeMode":null,"tessellate":-1,"extrude":0,"visibility":-1,"drawOrder":null,"icon":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11735634.67,-680559.26,0.0]}}]});
